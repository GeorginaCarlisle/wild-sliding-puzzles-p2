### The Strategy Plane

#### Users
The target audience enjoy solving puzzles. They may also be interested in wildlife, nature and our ‘Wild Isles’.

-	As a first-time user, I would like it to be immediately clear what sort of puzzle this is, and it’s theme.
-	As a first-time user, I would like clear instructions. These instructions should be accessible at all points without disrupting the puzzle.
-	As a first-time user, I want the controls for the puzzle to be clear and easy to use.

-	As a user, I want the puzzle to be achievable but still provide a level of challenge. The level of challenge should allow me to feel a sense of achievement on completion.
-	As a user, I want clear feedback when the puzzle has been completed.
-	As a user, I would like the option to choose a different puzzle.
-	As a user, I would like the option for sound effects and/or music to accompany the game.
-	As a user who is finding the puzzle difficult, I would like to be able to gain some extra help so that I can complete the puzzle. 

-	As a user who has completed a puzzle, I would like the option to play again. 
-	As a user who has completed a game, I would like to be shown a different puzzle on each subsequent game.
-	As a user who has completed multiple games, I would like to know once I have completed all available puzzles.

#### Owner

The owner is looking to:
-	Promote UK wildlife and wild landscapes and the work being done through the ‘Wild Isles’ project.
-	Provide users with information about some of our incredible wildlife and what is happening right now. 
-	Provide a link into further information about our ‘Wild Isles’ including how the user can help to make a difference.
